<p class="MsoNormal">After travelling for 16,5 hours, I've finally arrived in Los Angeles. I'm travelling with a good collegue of mine. We transfered in Amsterdam. I was unlucky and obviously the worlds tallast man got seat right in front of me. He insisted in having his seat laid down, which made the journey somewhat discomfortable. And it wasn't better when large frenchman sat next to me, he had some difficulties in using only on seat... Service was okay and they showed the new Indiana Jones movie, that together with the excitement of soon partipating in years biggest and most important developer conference made the journey worthwhile.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I'll get back tomorrow when I've finished the Advanced Windows Debugging pre-con session.</p>
