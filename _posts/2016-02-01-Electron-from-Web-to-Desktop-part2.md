In the [first part](http://http://madstt.dk/Electron-from-Web-to-Desktop-part1/) on my blog series about [Electron](http://http://electron.atom.io/) I outlined a the basics of getting started with Electron. I encourage you to read the first part before reading any further. This post will continue the work we did in the first part.

In this post I will outline how to automate the different tasks in using Electron with [gulp](http://http://gulpjs.com/).

gulp has been my favorite build system in the recent years. I like how gulp can automate the different related frontend tasks, such as building, testing, minifying, packing, etc. Tasks you do over and over again can be automated and aligned into a rather complex stream of tasks.
