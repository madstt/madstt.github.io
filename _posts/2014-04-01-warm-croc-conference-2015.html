<p>Disclaimer: This is not an Aprils fool.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of being announced as speaker for the <a href="http://thewcdc.net/">Warm Crocodile Developer Conference 2015</a> in Copenhagen. This will be my first major speaker appearance, and I’m very exited and pleased to be given this opportunity.</p>
<p>The session will cover some general unit testing approaches, and specifically how AutoFixture can facilitate clean and maintainable unit tests. I will introduce AutoFixture at a beginner’s level, moving toward more advanced applications, which even experienced users might find applicable. The title of the session will be “AutoFixture – From Basics to Nifties”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope to see you next year!</p>
