For a while I've been working on migrating my blog over from Wordpress to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). A number reasons is behind this decision.



- I really had a hard time working with the Wordpress themes, I couldn't find one that fitted my needs and I found customizations hard.
- I'm a markdown lover. It really fits my needs. I feel much more productive writing beautiful posts and notes using markdown. I try to use everywhere I can. I recently got markdown support in Confluence from Atlassian. We use Confluence for documents at work.
- The GitHub flow.
