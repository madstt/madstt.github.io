<p>I have always been reading a lot of stuff at the same time. Both magazines and books, technical and fiction. So instead of always dragging around with all these sources I considered buying an e-reader. It quickly turned out to be a choice between an iPad or an Amazon Kindle. The obvious family choice would be to choose the iPad, which would be an excellent toy for the kids and a device that the wife would use. I guess the arguments for buying an iPad is obvious. But for me, I needed a device for reading books, magazines and blogs. Sometime stuff comes in PDFs, so these were the requirements for me.</p>
<p>So I started researching how the Kindle versus the iPad performed in a read-only setting.&#160; Factors like size, weight, e-ink, and no reflecting LCD, so reading outside is possible, is decisive for making the Kindle a more superior choice than the iPad. On the other hand, the iPad has a great browser for reading blogs, e-mail support, and better at formatting PDFs. I read <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AmazonKindle.aspx">Hanselmans</a> blog post on the Kindle, and it seemed that formatting technical books is rather lousy on the Kindle. </p>
<p>Quickly it turned out that the Kindle is the iPad superior when it comes to being an e-reader. But would I miss out on technical books and blog posts? So to complete my research I downloaded a Kindle version of one of the technical books I’m reading (the eBook came free when you have bought the pBook, thank you <a href="http://bit.ly/QvlgtC">Manning</a>). I loaded it into the <a href="http://amzn.to/Qvld0R">Kindle desktop reader</a>, so I could get an idea how it would be formatted. It was actually formatted quite well. I know that I shouldn’t take the desktop version as a definitive conclusion on the formatting, since different devices renders the books differently. To be able to read blog posts on the Kindle could be some sort of a challenge. Then I read this <a href="http://bit.ly/Qvo2iA">blog post</a>, about how to use <a href="http://bit.ly/Qvo9e2">Instapaper</a> for storing web page for reading later and synchronizing them with your Kindle. It uses the unique e-mail address, that every Kindle has for sending personal documents to your Kindle. These documents are also stored in the Amazon cloud storage. So when there is a new article your Instapaper Read Later folder is send to your Kindle at a certain time of the day. Cool. The Instapaper article is a stripped down version of the blog post, where only the text is saved.</p>
<p>Finally, when Amazon lowered their pricing on the Kindle on 6th of September from $109 to $89, I ordered the <a href="http://amzn.to/QvpoKh">basic Kindle</a>, the 6” version. Together with a leather casing and a power adapter. I would have ordered the <a href="http://amzn.to/QvpDVx">Paperwhite</a> edition, but this is not available outside the US.</p>
<p>In a later blog post I’ll provide my initial experiences.</p>
