<p>A couple of weeks ago I pursuited my employer to let me register for <a href="http://www.microsoftpdc.com">Microsoft Professional Developers Conference</a> in Los Angeles. The conference is set to rumble from the 27th - 30th of</p>
<p>October. It will be held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. I've registered for pre-conference as well, which is a day-long session on a specific issue. I've chosen <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/Agenda/Preconference.aspx#advanced-windows-debugging">Advanced Windows Debugging</a>, of which I'm having high expectations.<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-7" title="bling2" src="assets/bling2.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="150" /></p>
<p>I still haven't made any specific plans for which sessions to attend, but I do know that I'll attend the session where Anders Hejlsberg is given a speech under the title, 'The Future of C#'.</p>
